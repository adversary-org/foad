This code began in part as a joke, much like the `Fuck Off As A
Service <http://www.foaas.com>`_ site did and which was the inital
basis for this script.  In the process of writing it and then porting
it from Python 2.7 to Python 3.4 it also came to be a useful project
to demonstrate certain differences in the languages I needed to learn.

Since then it has grown considerably, includes well over two hundred
options and can be run as a stand alone script or imported as a
module.  The intention is to run it as a stand alone script.  The most
common uses for it are when used in conjunction with IRC or Twitter.
Occasionally with an SMS gateway.
